# D-OS
Introducing: D-OS. A os (operating system) made in replit with python. The original one didn't get updates since 2018 so I decided to fork it and update it regularly.

# how can i play it?
you can simply play it on your browser or replit app.

# is it compatible with all devices?
if your device supports a browser, yes!

# will you add more features?
normally! you can make a issue with your suggestion or if you found a bug. 

# is there a community to know the latest updates? 
yes! here: https://discord.gg/5nF3PJrXkh

# is D-OS open source?
yes. you can fork it on replit but there's also source code so you can remake it with python. to see the source code, press "view code" below.
