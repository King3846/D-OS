**D-OS on Replit**

hello, D-OS on Replit has been shut down. This decision was made after careful consideration and due to a number of factors, including:

* **Technical challenges:** D-OS is a complex project and i have encountered a number of technical challenges that have made it difficult to develop.
* **Maintenance burden:** The maintenance burden for D-OS has become increasingly difficult to manage.


**What does this mean for you?**

If you were using D-OS on Replit, you will no longer be able to access the repl.

**What happens next?**

The GitHub page for D-OS will be archived. This means that it will still be available for reference, but it will no longer be updated.

thank you for playing.
