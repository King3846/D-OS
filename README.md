# D-OS
Introducing: D-OS. A os made in replit with python. The original one didn't get updates since 2018 so I decided to fork it and update it regularly.

you can simply play it on your browser or replit app.

# is it compatible with all devices?
if your device supports a browser, yes!

# will you add more features?
normally! you can make a issue with your suggestion or if you found a bug.
